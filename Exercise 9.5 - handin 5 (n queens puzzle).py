'''One way to structure your program is to define three functions:

valid(r1, c1, r2, c2) that checks if two queens at positions (r1, c1) and (r2, c2) 
respectively do not threaten each other (i.e. are in different rows and columns and not on the same diagonal).

print_solution(solution) that prints a solution given by a list solution where 
queen i is at position (i,solution(i)).

solve(solution) is a recursive function that tries to expand a partial solution 
given by solution for the first len(solution) queens.
