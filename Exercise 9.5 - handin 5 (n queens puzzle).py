'''
Write a program that solves the eight queens puzzle. 
The program should solve the more general problem of solving the n queen problem on an n x n chessboard, 
where n is given as input. The program should output at least one solution if solutions exist, 
e.g. as below, or that there is no solution.

Size of board: 5
